# Contributing

Contributions to Primo are very welcome. You can start by submitting a PR to address any of the [open issues](https://github.com/primocms/primo/issues), but for the sake of keeping the codebase simple and aligned towards the project's mission, we ask that you first start a discussion before attempting to contribute any new features. You can do this by starting a discussion in the [Forum](https://forum.primo.so), [Github Discussions](https://github.com/primocms/primo/discussions), or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/vzSFTS9).
